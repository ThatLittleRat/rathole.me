      <h2>📜 My Story</h2>
      <p>It all started with an eraser.</p>
      <p>One day in school, I was crawling under my classmate’s desk trying to find it. She looked down, saw me under there, and screamed in laughter:</p>
      <blockquote>“<strong>Patkány!!</strong>” (which means <em>rat</em> in Hungarian)</blockquote>
      <p>From that moment, the name stuck. Everyone started calling me Rat — and instead of running from it, I owned it. That's how <strong>ThatLittleRat</strong> was born.</p>

      <h2>🧠 My Coding Journey</h2>
      <p>I live in the <strong>Balkans</strong>, and I’m <strong>Hungarian</strong> — but I speak English and Serbian fluently too. I got into computers super young.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>💡 Started being curious about computers in 2nd grade</li>
        <li>🧪 Began coding in 4th grade</li>
        <li>🐍 Learned Python, built websites, games, and random tools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now I’m building a platformer, organizing my ultimate PC setup plan, and making my own site — this one right here!</p>
